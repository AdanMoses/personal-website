# PERSONAL WEBSITE

The goal is to do a front-end only React app for my personal website. Must be interactive and catch the eye of that who visits it. As you scroll throughout the website things will float over and under the website's title (my name and title) as well as the rights-side nav-bar, colors will also flow as the website is scrolled.

## Technologies

This will be a simple front-end only React app, I'm trying to focus on getting better at React and at design to it definitely will be a challenge.

I'm using:

- React Router
- React Scroll
- Styled Components
