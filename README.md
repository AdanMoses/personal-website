# PERSONAL WEBSITE

The goal is to do a front-end only React app for my personal website. Must be interactive and catch the eye of that who visits it. As you scroll throughout the website things will float over and under the website's title (my name and title) as well as the rights-side nav-bar, colors will also flow as the website is scrolled.

## Check it out

My website is live at:

## Technologies

This will be a simple front-end only React app, I'm trying to focus on getting better at React and at design to it definitely will be a challenge.

I'm using:

- React Router Dom
- React Scroll
- Styled Components
- React Icons


## Challenges

There were tons of challenges for me on this project, one because I struggled (and still do a bit) with Objects and Classes, and two, because I am not a very good visual designer. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me realise a lot of things. I am glad I went with a front-end only app and I am happy with the overall look and feel of the website, although I would've wanted something a bit more experimental. 


## What next?

There's a few features that I wasn't able to complete in time but will get done over the next couple of weeks:

- Displaying More About Me speech as a drop-down menu (like I did with the mobile menu icon)
- Displaying my resume as a drop-down menu 
- Displaying the contact me form as a drop-down menu
- Potentially adding some Parallax effect to the SVGs

## TODO

Check buttons classes, need to click to run function for dropdown
